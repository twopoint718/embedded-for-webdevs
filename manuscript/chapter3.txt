# Hardware

In this part we'll take what we've learned about the fundamentals of how computers work and apply that to the actual hardware design.
In these chapters we'll cover what you need to know to design your own boards, get them produced, and assemble them once you have them.

Also in this part of the book, I’ll introduce our companion along the way, our project, Orientation-sensitive Task Timer (TODO: name this thing!).
From here on out talking about hardware or software in the abstract is out and concrete is in.
It'll be ``in order to hook up I2C to the orientation sensor, we'll...'' and not ``here's how the SDA and SCL lines work.''
I can motivate everything by referring to the project that's gradually taking shape!
Don't worry though, the background details that you've learned in [[Essentials of Computation]] will still be relevant in fact they'll form the bedrock to build more understanding upon.
I find that it's so helpful to learn something about /why/ I'm learning a thing /while/ I’m learning it.
