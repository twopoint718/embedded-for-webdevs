# Embedded for Webdevs

## An Investigation of Hardware for the Curious

KEYWORDS: Hardware, Embedded Development, Cortex-M, Rust

This is a book about embedded software for web developers.
It's a project-based approach where we'll together, and step-by-step, create a desktop task timer.
We go through each and every phase that you'd do for a polished hobby-level project:

- Draw architecture diagrams, plans, state machines
- Choose a chip with peripherals and external sensors
- Create schematics and board layouts in KiCAD
- Write firmware (currently planning Rust and/or C++)
- Create 3D cad models for a case

This is a big project, but I think it's accessible to the newcomer.
The book's style is that of an extended pair-programming session where we go through not just what we did but _how_ and _why_ we did it.

I hope you'll join me.
